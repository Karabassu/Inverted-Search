# Data Structure using C | Inverted-Search
The Inverted Search Project in C implements an inverted index using hashing. It indexes words from multiple documents, mapping them to document locations. Users can query words, retrieving documents containing them. The project focuses on efficient indexing, searching, and using hashing for fast retrieval.
